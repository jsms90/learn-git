# Learn git

This workshop has been made for students of [Founders and Coders](www.founderandcoders.com), and therefore assumes that you have:
 + created a one-page website before (as part of the [prerequisites](www.founderandcoders.com/apply))
 + completed lesson 1 of [Udacity's Git and GitHub course](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775) (as part of the [precourse material](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/tree/master/coursebook/precourse))
 + created issues on each other's websites (as part of [this accessibilty workshop](https://github.com/jsms90/web-accessibility/blob/master/putting-yourself-in-someone-elses-shoes.md#exercises) on [day 1](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/tree/master/coursebook/week-1) of the course)

 **All contributions to this workshop are very welcome!** If you have any suggestions for improvements, please raise an issue, and then follow the [contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) before making a pull request.

## Getting ready to work
Your workshops are designed for collaborative learning, so grab a partner and use one computer.

Now your pair should find another pair and choose one person's one-page website from the [prerequisites](www.foundersandcoders.com/apply) to work on. Make sure the author of the website that you choose is someone who is happy for you to be committing changes.

Each pair should pick a different issue from the ones that were raised in yesterday's [accessibility workshop](https://github.com/jsms90/web-accessibility/blob/master/putting-yourself-in-someone-elses-shoes.md#exercises).

When you start working on issues, you should always "assign" yourself. Assigning yourself let's other collaborators know what you're doing, so they don't also decide to work on that issue. It stops you from duplicating work :+1:

If you can't assign yourself, that's because you're not a member of the organisation that the repo is sitting in, and you haven't been added as a collaborator by the creator of the repo. So repo owners, you'll want to add your team as "collaborators" by going to Settings -> Collaborators, and entering their github handles.

Note: this will not be necessary when you work on repos that are in the foundersandcoders or FAC10 organisation, as you are already members, and therefore automatically added with relevant access to new repos.

## Start working

Remembering to use one computer per pair, you can now start working on the issue.

Note: Since the creator of the repo has allowed you "collaborator" rights, you don't need to fork this repository first.

Go ahead and clone the repo, so you can work on it locally.

Remember, you will automatically be on the `master` branch. So the first thing you want to do is create a new branch, with an appropriate name for the work you are about to do, and then move to this branch.

Just before you can start `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`-ing, let's look at the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) file in this workshop repo.

It is a good idea to use multi-line commits (e.g. two `-m` flags), with the second line being a reference to the issue that you are working on.

Ok, now you're ready to start working. Remember to keep your commits granular, and push often, so that your branch on GitHub is as up-to-date as possible.

When you have finished making changes, and you think the issue is finished, you'll want to submit a pull request for the other pair to take a look at.
