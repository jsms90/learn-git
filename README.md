# Learn git

This workshop has been made for students of [Founders and Coders](www.founderandcoders.com), and therefore assumes that you have:
 + created a one-page website before (as part of the [prerequisites](www.founderandcoders.com/apply))
 + completed lesson 1 of [Udacity's Git and GitHub course](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775) (as part of the [precourse material](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/tree/master/coursebook/precourse))
 + created issues on each other's websites (as part of [this accessibilty workshop](https://github.com/jsms90/web-accessibility/blob/master/putting-yourself-in-someone-elses-shoes.md#exercises) on [day 1](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/tree/master/coursebook/week-1) of the course)

 **All contributions to this workshop are very welcome!** If you have any suggestions for improvements, please raise an issue, and then follow the [contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) before making a pull request.

## Workshop
Your workshops are designed for collaborative learning, so grab a partner and use one computer.

Choose one person's one-page website from the [prerequisites](www.foundersandcoders.com/apply) to work on. Pick an issue from the ones that were raised in yesterday's [accessibility workshop](https://github.com/jsms90/web-accessibility/blob/master/putting-yourself-in-someone-elses-shoes.md#exercises).

When you start working on issues, you should always assign yourself. Assigning yourself means that other collaborators won't also decide to work on that issue. It stops you from duplicating work :+1:
